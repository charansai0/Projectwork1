## DIABETIC RETINOPATHY DETECTION USING INCEPTION V3 AS A BASE MODEL FOR DIAGNOSING SEVERITY 


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The project focuses on developing an automated system for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) using a deep learning model based on Inception V3 architecture. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in diabetic patients, particularly those with Type 2 diabetes. Early and accurate detection of DR can help prevent severe vision loss.

In this project, the Inception V3 model, a well-known deep convolutional neural network (CNN), is employed using transfer learning to identify and classify retinal fundus images into five categories based on the severity of DR:

No DR,Mild DR,Moderate DR,Severe DR,Proliferative DR

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
### Hardware Requirements:
GPU: A GPU like NVIDIA Tesla, RTX, or any CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended for faster training of deep learning models.

RAM: At least 16 GB RAM (preferably more for handling large datasets).

Storage: 50–100 GB of storage for datasets, model weights, and result logs.

CPU: A multi-core processor for general tasks and non-GPU operations.

### Software Requirements:
Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu or similar), Windows, or macOS.

Programming Language: Python (preferably version 3.7+).

### Python Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras: For implementing and training the Inception V3 model using transfer learning.

OpenCV or Pillow: For image preprocessing (resizing, normalization).

Scikit-learn: For implementing k-fold cross-validation and performance evaluation metrics.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization of model performance, learning curves, confusion matrices, etc.

Pandas/Numpy: For data manipulation and analysis.

### Dataset Requirements:
Labeled Fundus Images: A dataset containing retinal fundus images, labeled with DR severity (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative DR).

Example Datasets: Kaggle’s APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection, IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset), or Messidor-2.

Image Size: Images need to be resized (typically 224x224 for Inception V3 input).

The model achieved a 92% accuracy in detecting and classifying different stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). This high level of accuracy demonstrates the model’s effectiveness in distinguishing between No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR.

The model was able to correctly classify retinal fundus images into five distinct classes, showing good performance across all DR stages. The balanced classification results indicate that the model handles different severity levels well, with no significant bias toward any particular class.

The use of Inception V3 with transfer learning allowed the model to leverage pre-trained weights, significantly reducing the amount of time and data needed for training. The model benefited from the powerful feature extraction capabilities of Inception V3, leading to high classification accuracy.
